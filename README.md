<h3 align="center">Hey there! I'm Penny</h3>

<h4 align="start">About me</h4>

I am a creative software developer, specialising in the app development arena. For the last 3 years, I have been developing web-based applications using front-end programming languages. 

I believe in personal development and growth, as well as life-long learning. I am always interested in new consepts and technologies so when Iâ€™m not working on software engineering projects, I'm spending time reading about the modern frameworks and latest technologies. 

Here you will find a small sample of projects I've developed.
